		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>My name is Maria Mancheno and I’m from Quito, Ecuador. I’m 21 years old and I currently go to the University of Rochester. My major is in Digital Media Studies and I’m also doing a minor in Math. My hobbies include playing soccer, playing the guitar and reading. I work as a social media manager and web developer at the Peak Lab in the University of Rochester Medical Center. This last summer I had the opportunity to do an internship in an Ecuadorian firm where I was able to improve my programming skills. My favorite thing is to travel around the world to learn about new cultures and meet new interesting people.</p>

		<h2>Early Days</h2>
		<p>In Ecuador, kinder, primary and secondary are only one school. So, I can say I went to the same school for 14 years. The name of my school was American School of Quito, which is the city where I’m from. My favorite teacher was my Physics teacher from my two last years of high school. I also did the International Baccalaureate Program, where you have to choose two natural science classes and a social science class, or vice versa. I ended up choosing Economics, Physics and History. It was a good combination but very demanding as well. Overall my experience at the school was great. I met a lot of people, who’ve been my friends since we were 4 years old. I know the school made a good job in getting me prepared for college life. </p>

		<h2>Personal Life</h2>
		<p>I began playing the guitar when I was 9 years old. I received private lessons at my house and the beginning it was a bit frustrating because it takes time until chords actually start to sound properly. Yet, I knew that instrument was meant for me and I never gave up. I play the guitar every single day and there is not a single place that I go without my guitar. It’s not only an instrument but one of the best possible companions. I began playing soccer even earlier, when I was about 7 years old. I think much of my soccer passion came from my dad’s influence, as he is a soccer lover. I play as a forward and I’m currently part of the club soccer team at the University of Rochester. Finally, my last hobby is reading. I’ve always liked to read, but I used to make up a lot of excuses and didn’t end up reading as much as I would have wanted. Therefore, my 2019 new year’s resolution included reading 24 book throughout the year. I made time to read at least 30 minutes every day. I finished my goal about three weeks ago and I’m currently on my 26th book now. </p>
