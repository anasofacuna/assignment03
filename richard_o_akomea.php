		<h2>Early Days</h2>
		<p>Richard's parents divorced when he was ten years old. After the divorce, he and his Father remained in Accra, while his mother returned to Batsonaa, where she pursued her Masters Degree in Education and went on to teach Twi in S.D.A Primary Schools. Joyce's limited finances and health issues caused her to remain close to Accra until Richard's early adulthood. Three years after their divorce , Richard met and married Paulinaa Ohenewaa, a Trader. Richard was raised in two Ghanaian neighbourhoods. He lived on Okle Mantse Road in Accra until grade nine, playing soccer with the Sakumonon School complex team. He then moved to Gbawe in 2012 to live with his Father and Step-mother after their marriage.</p>

		<h2>Personal Life</h2>
		<p>As a child, Richard played for amateur team Young Kotoko from 2011 to 2012, in Ardoggon ,Spintex Road, and later spent a couple of months with Sweps FC . In 2014, aged 17, he went on a three-day trial with Sweps FC senior team, but didn't make the final cut for the 23 man team. He subsequently moved from Accra to Gbawe, where he joined the Gbawe DC school Local pick up team. By age 10, Richard believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and tried to convince his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on soccer. While popular with other students at school, he known rather for his academic achievements than his soccer playing skills or football as it is called in Ghana and everywhere else in the world. However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a right knee contusion, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing soccer.</p>
