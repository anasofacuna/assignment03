		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>As a fifth-year student at the University of Rochester, I am double majoring in Business Finance and Art History, with a minor in Computer Science. Due to computer science and codingâ€™s popularity and its extensive use in all kinds of fields and the business world, I have decided to re-classify from Class of 2019 to Class of 2020 in order to complete this challenging but extremely useful minor and coding abilities. Until now, I have acquired coding experience including Python, R Studio, HTML, CSS and little knowledge of JavaScript Plugins and I am thrilled to learn more from both my professors and classmates.</p>

		<h2>Early Days</h2>
		<p>My hometown is in Shanghai, China, but I have moved to San Francisco Bay Area since when I was thirteen years old. I studied at a Christian school in which I skipped my eighth grade and started from high school immediately. During my fantastic four years in high school, I have demonstrated strong interest in visual designs and various categories of art including calligraphy, painting, photography, and etc. With further curiosity, I have begun learning the technological instruments and software, particularly Adobe Photoshop and Blender.</p>

		<h2>Personal Life</h2>
		<p>Outside of school works and internships, I spend my free time with my hobbies and moreover exploring my possibilities in different kinds of areas, including sports and music. I am particularly interested in playing tennis, swimming, skiing, and golf. During other times, I have dedicated my energy to philanthropy and charity activities in which I consider them significant and memorable. For six years, I have gone to Seattle annually and served as a volunteer to plan and hold fundraisers in order to help with the education of vision-impaired children; and the program has helped over fifty students to progress from elementary school through college.</p>
